## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
(sqrt(25) - 3) * 2
```

```{r}
letters.in.first.name = 4
letters.in.last.name = 5

average.letters.in.name = (letters.in.first.name + letters.in.last.name) / 2
average.letters.in.name
```

```{r}
names.length.1 = c(4, 5)
names.length.2 = c(letters.in.first.name, letters.in.last.name)
```

```{r}
names = c("Ryan", "Cheng")
names
```

```{r}
seq(from = 7, to = 87, by = 2)
```
```{r}
my.answers = c(0, 1, 17, 6)
```
```{r}
sort(my.answers, decreasing = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
